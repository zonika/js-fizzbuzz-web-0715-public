# FizzBuzz
Fizzbuzz is the time honored example program in which you need to write a program that returns "Fizz" for numbers divided by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divided by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both.  If a number is not divisible by either just return the number.  Now go JavaScript!

To run the specs follow these commands:
```shell
# first install the new gem to run the tests
gem sources -a http://flatiron:33west26@gems.flatironschool.com
gem install learn-co

# to run in the command line run
learn

#to run in the browser
learn -b
```
